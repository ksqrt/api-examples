# CANedge 데이터 분석 및 시각화

CSS-Electronics사의 파이썬 API 를 활용해 CANedge 데이터 전처리
이후 InfluxDB 와 Grafana 를 통한 데이터 시각화

## 개발환경

---

Python 3.8.10  
Docker 20.10.17  
influxdb  
grafana

## 파일구조

---

<!-- ## 실행방법

---

```
/home/test/api-examples/ canedge-influxdb-writer-master

안의 inputs.py 의 DBC 와 MF4 파일을 원하는대로 수정한뒤

linux 는 source env/bin/activate 로
 virtual environment 에 진입한뒤
 python3 main.py 로 데이터 전송


``` -->

## Features

```
For most use cases we recommend to start with the below examples:
- data-processing: List log files, load them and DBC decode the data (local, S3)

For some use cases the below examples may be useful:
- other/asammdf-basics: Load and concatenate MF4 logs, DBC decode them - and save as new MF4 files
- other/matlab-basics: Examples of how to load and use MF4/MAT CAN bus data
- other/s3-basics: Examples of how to download, upload or list specific objects on your server
- other/s3-events: Using AWS Lambda or MinIO notifications (for event based data processing)
- other/misc: Example of automating the use of the MDF4 converters and misc tools

```

## Installation

- Install Python 3.7 for Windows ([32 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9.exe)/[64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe)) or [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) (_enable 'Add to PATH'_)
- Download this project as a zip via the green button and unzip it
- Open the folder with the `requirements.txt` file and enter below in your [command prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSSJQolR0E&t=47s):

##### Windows

```
python -m venv env & env\Scripts\activate & pip install -r requirements.txt
python script_to_run.py
```

##### Linux

```
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
python script_to_run.py
```

If you later need to re-activate the virtual environment, use `env\Scripts\activate`.

## Sample data (MDF4 & DBC)

The various folders include sample log files and DBC files. Once you've tested a script with the sample data, you can replace it with your own.

---

## Usage info

- Some example folders contain their own `README.md` files for extra information
- These example scripts are designed to be minimal and to help you get started - not for production
- Some S3 scripts use hardcoded credentials to ease testing - for production see e.g. [this guide](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html)

## Which API modules to use?

There are many ways that you can work with the data from your CANedge devices. Most automation use cases involve fetching data from a specific device and time period - and DBC decoding this into a dataframe for further processing. Here, we recommend to look at the examples from the `data-processing/` folder. These examples use our custom modules designed for use with the CANedge: The [mdf_iter](https://pypi.org/project/mdf-iter/) (for loading MDF4 data), the [canedge_browser](https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/canedge_browser) (for fetching specific data locally or from S3) and the [can_decoder](https://github.com/CSS-Electronics/can_decoder) (for DBC decoding the data). In combination, these modules serve to support most use cases.

If you have needs that are not covered by these modules, you can check out the other examples using the asammdf API, the AWS/MinIO S3 API and our MDF4 converters.
